## Summer Term 2024

Currently, I work as an "Assistent" for the course "Analysis II für Ingenieurwissenschaften" at TU Berlin, for further information see the <a href="https://isis.tu-berlin.de/course/view.php?id=37634">ISIS webpage</a>. 

## Previous terms

Previously, after tutoring experience during my BSc studies in Freiburg, I have served as an "Assistent" in several courses of the Mathematics and Business Mathematics BSc and MSc programmes at TU Berlin, under <a href="https://www3.math.tu-berlin.de/stoch/wp_bank/">Prof. Dr. Peter Bank</a>, <a href="">Prof. Dr. Christoph Knochenhauer</a>, and <a href="">Prof. Dr. Wolfgang König</a> since October 2019, namely:

## What is an "Assistent"?

"Assistent" (German) = person in charge of:

* structuring, preparing and conducting a course (called “Übung”), that both a) accompanies the main lecture by providing supplementary contents, in the form of propositions and examples, and b) serves as an exercise class (2) creating exercises including solutions and further remarks for tutorials (called “Tutorium”)
* conducting tutorials
* creating homework tasks including solutions (weekly)
* correcting homework submissions (weekly)
* creating examination tasks including solutions (twice per term)
* pre-correcting examination submissions (twice per term)
* assisting in oral examinations
* administration (website, IT, examinations, rooms)
* managing the communication between lecturer and tutors

Not all of these points may apply for all courses. There are course with both Übung and Tutorium, there are courses with only one of it. Some courses have oral, others written examinations.

SWS = Semesterwochenstunden = cum tempore hours of courses to be taught per term
